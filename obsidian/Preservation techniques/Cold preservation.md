Cold temperatures slow down the reproduction of bacteria in the food very effectively. That's why this is one of the most common ways of making food last longer. There are two types of cold preservation: **positive cold** (fridge) and **negative cold** (freezer). 

>Cold temperatures just slow down the bacteria, but don't kill them.

>There are specific bags for refrigeration and for freezing.

### Fridges

Sometimes we want to preserve fishes and meats on the fridge for 1 - 2 days and keep them fresh., In these cases, raw fishes and meats can generate some liquid with strong smells, and it's important to make sure that the liquid is not in contact with them. There are two complementary ways to avoid it:

- Use a tupperware with small drain layer at the bottom.
- Wrap it in a piece of absorbent paper, so that the liquid is absorbed away.

>In addition, we can use a plastic bag full of ice on top of the ingredient to slow down bacteria even more.

There are some products that contain some humidity, like chorizos, embutidos and some cheeses. It's a bad idea to wrap them in plastic them because they won't be able to transpire, and if we don't let the humidity out, it will likely generate moss.

In these cases, we should put an absorbent paper under the product, and place it in the place of the freezer where there's an air current (near the ventilation system). An alternative to the absorbent paper underneath is to hang them from a specific hanger.

### Freezers

To effectively preserve things in the freezer, we should use plastic bags (there are specific bags for this) that don't leave almost any air inside. This makes it much easier to freeze things fast, which is the desirable thing. Otherwise, it will generate a lot of liquid when we unfreeze it, thus loosing volume and flavour.

>For this reason, if we have to freeze a high amount of product, it's better to freeze them separately in tight small bags, and once it's freezed, cluster them together for better organization inside the freezer.

>It's imperative to use labels for each thing we put in the freezer. Otherwise, it's going to be imposible to identify it in the future. The label should contain the name and the date of freezing.


When we take a product from the freezer, we should never leave it out on a plate to slowly unfreeze is not recommended. It's much better to leave it on the fridge to unfreeze, so that we make sure that it never reaches temperatures that are benefitial for bacteria.

### Leftovers

It's common to have some leftover food that we want to put into the fridge or freezer, but it's still hot. Waiting for the food to cool down is a mistake, because we  should avoid temperatures between 25ºC and 40ºC (where bacteria proliferate more) as much as possible. Putting hot food in the fridge is also a bad idea because that would increase its temperature.

The best solution is to put that food in a plastic bag and putting the bag in a pot full of water with ice. That way, the temperature of the product will go down as fast as possible, avoiding medium temperatures and improving its preservation.

Once the bag is cold, we should seal it, making sure that we leave absolutely no air inside it.
