Sugar, just like salt, is effective for food preservation, like jams, jellies, compotes or candying (escarchado). It substitutes the liquid inside the products by sugar, making it more difficult for bacteria to proliferate.

>One traditional way of preservation through sugar is honey. An example is the traditional "arrope", which consists of cooking pumpkin, melon and other fruits  in honey, evaporating its water and substituting it by honey. This way, those fruits could last for many years.

There are multiple types of sugar: white, brown, etc. All of them are very good ways to preserve. An example is the candied fruit (fruta escarchada). To candy a fruit we can bleach it (blanquearla / escaldarla), killing all the bacteria on its surface. Then, we put it on very hot syrup (almÃ­bar). We have to add more sugar several times,  letting the syrup concentrate more and more. 

>Another popular way to preserve fruit through sugar is making jam, which can last for very, very long.
