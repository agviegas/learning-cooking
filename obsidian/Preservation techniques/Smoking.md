Smoking is a very ancient process that has barely changed (although now there are specific domestic equipment to achieve it).

Like the name indicates, smoking consists of exposing food to hot smoke coming from a fire. Depending on the burning material, it can contain some antibiotics particles that kill bacteria and dries out the products, making them last for longer. It can also add flavour and texture.

>Many products can be smoked: all sorts of meats (e.g. chorizo) and fishes (e.g. salmon).
