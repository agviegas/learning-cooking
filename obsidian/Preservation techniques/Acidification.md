Acidification consists of putting products on an acid solution that make it hard for bacteria to proliferate, like vinegar. This method is useful for vegetables and fishes. This won't only preserve it, but modify its flavour and smell. It's a very old preservation method and it's still very common nowadays.

>A very common example are products like pickles, olives and "encurtidos", which we can get in any supermarket.

The acid solution alters the product, even "cooking" the it. There are 3 big products that are the result of this:

- Anchovies in vinegar (boquerones en vinagre).
- Marinade (escabeche).
- Ceviche.
