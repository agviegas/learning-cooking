Salting (salazÃ³n) consists of adding a lot of salt to a product, so that it gives away all the water. Therefore, all bacteria that could proliferate on it die, making it last for longer.

For instance, the cod (bacalao) is a fish that can be conserved in salt for a long time, even without refrigeration. However, when we put it on water, we are making it a fresh fish again, and from that moment it will last 4-5 days only. Putting it on water makes it better to eat, but worse to preserve.

>Historically, salting has been the most popular way to preserve fish. It was the only way to bring fishes from the coast to the interior lands (before trucks with refrigeration systems). It was also used for meat sometimes, although for this there were other preservation methods.

Nowadays we usually don't want to completely remove the water from products with salting. Instead, we make mid-term preservation, taking advantage of the fact that it modifies the texture and flavour of products.

>For instance, we could preserve a salmon with salt (1kg), brown sugar (500g) and pepper, as well as  lime and orange zest (ralladura). We could use whatever herbs and spices we want. This way, we would preserve that salmon for a longer time and give it an interesting flavour / texture. After 24h, we could wash it and dry it with a piece of paper, and we'll see that it has a more curated / darker texture (like ham). This method is not a full-salting, but half-salting, because it's not meant to preserve the product for a really long time.

Salting (even slight salting) reduces liquid in the product, so that we concentrate the flavour.

If we make a full salting (e.g. a cod), the product will be completely dry and could be preserved for months or even years. The downside is that this product can't be eaten like this directly because its flavour is too strong. We should put it on water and remove the salt from it. After doing this, the product would last for 4/5 days only. This would also concentrate the flavour, transforming the cod from a white fish to a oily fish.

Salting is also used in some meats, like ham. Ham is pressed to take out the blood and put in salt (dehidrating it). After this, it's curated and air-dried (oreada). In this case salt is not part of the product, so it's different from the fish processed.
