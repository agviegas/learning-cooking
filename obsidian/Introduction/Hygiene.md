### Products

It's fundamental to keep the whole kitchen clean to prevent intoxications. There are 3 types of products:

>The **products for our hands**. The most basic thing is to wash our hands with soap before starting to cook. 

>The **products for the kitchen**. Disinfectant products that contain chlorine are recommended. They should be applied in walls and floors.

> The **products for the working areas**. It's recommended to have a kitchen-specific spray and a kitchen towel because it's handy and fast to use. Also, we should have a grease remover.


### Frequency

Regarding the frequency, we should wash:

- **Frequently**: the whole kitchen: floors, walls, etc.
- **After each cooking**: the working areas and walls nearby, tables, tools and machines.
- **After touching raw meat**: our hands, knives and working area to prevent **cross contamination**.

```
Cross contamination happens when we use the same knife with a raw meat and then with a fresh ingredient (like a vegetable). Bacteria in that meat can pass to the fresh ingredients, increasing the risk of intoxication. It can also happen if we don't wash our hands after manipulating raw meats.
```


### Tools

We should have at least 6 cleaning tools in our kitchen, each with a specific purpose:

- **Latex gloves**: for cleaning the kitchen and protect our hands against the products.

- **Sponge** (estropajo): to clean dishes and tools.

- **Kitchen roll**: better than using the cloths for everything. Cloths accumulate dirt, whereas paper are used and discarded.

- **Cleaning wipes** (bayetas):  for working areas, walls and furniture.

- **Microfiber cloth**: for vitroceramic hobs and other special surfaces.

- **Cook towel** (trapo de cocinero): manipulate hot pots, clean something small super fast, etc. It's not actually a proper cleaning tool but something flexible to be used in the cooking process.

>These towels must be used only for the kitchen.

>All cloths should be cleaned at least once a week in the laundry, while sponges can be cleaned in the dishwasher.


### Tables

It's good to have relatively big tables for cutting and working. They should either be made of plastic or rigid wood, and it's recommended to have at least 2 of them: one for meats and fishes, and other for the rest (vegetables, fruits, etc).

### Trashcan

It's better if it has a pedal so that we don't have to touch it with our hands directly.
