**Mise en place** is the preparation of all necessary elements before starting to cook a specific recipe: ingredients, tools, machines, knowledge, etc. We need to display everything on a surface nearby the preparation area.

It's a french term used in professional kitchens globally, but it's useful for domestic kitchens as well. In professional restaurants this happens in the hours previous to the opening and the main purpose is to make the cooking process as agile as possible. 

Mise en place includes actions like:

- Purchasing or ordering dishes that are already done (e.g. desserts).
- For a stew, soaking the chickpeas the night before.
- For a caesar salad, cooking a chicken breast beforehand so that they are cold when we manipulate them.

Some important things to keep in mind:

>Prepare everything for the recipe, but nothing else. The cleaner the working area, the better.

> Keep cleaning products far away from the working area while cooking.

>Always have a kitchen paper roll. It's handy because it's used and discarded.
