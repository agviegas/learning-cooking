- We should avoid having things for "just in case". It's better to plan and just have what we need.
- Avoid keeping the fridge / freezer full.
- We should keep the pantry (despensa) far away from heat sources (e.g. the oven).
- We should empty the fridge and clean it at least once a month with a product with chlorine (avoid soapy products / productos muy jabonosos).

- In fridges, the top part is the coldes. Therefore: 
	- the products that need cleaning (vegetables) should be on the bottom.
	- the fresh products (meats, fishes) can be on the center.
	- the products that are consumed raw (embutidos, mayonaisse, yogurt, butters, etc).
	- eggs should also be on the top.


- For the freezer, we should always use stickers for tupperwares.
