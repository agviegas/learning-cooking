### Utensils

It's nice to have the following utensils. They will be more or less necessary depending on the recipes that we want to prepare. The size depends on the number of people we will cook for.

- **Tupperwares** to store ingredients and ellaborations. They should be sturdy and hermetic.
- At least one **plastic jug** to measure liquids.
- Two **scissors**: 
	- Big, sturdy, steel scissors to cut/carve meat/fish. They must allow us to apply pressure.
	- Small scissors for anything else. 
- At least one medium **rod** (varilla) for stirring liquids. They should be flexible: plastic or metal.
- A **rigid plastic spatula**. They substitute traditional wooden spoons, which can contain bacteria.
- A **steel spatula** to move sofritos, scrape food stuck to surfaces, etc.
- A **grater** (rallador). It shouldn't be too small.
- A **peeler**. The horseshoe-shaped steel one is very popular.

- **Small steel tongs** (pinzas) to remove fish bones.
- **Medium tongs** (pinzas) to move things we are cooking on the pan.
- **Ceramic mortar** prepare picadas, sauces, aiolis, mojos, etc.
- **Skimmer** (araña) to take away frying things without the oil.
- **Skimmer** (espumadera) to retire impurities from liquids.
- **Ladles** (cucharon, tazo) para salsas y guisos.
- **Steel strainer** (colador de malla).
- **Scale** to weight the food.

For pastry it's also nice to have:
