### Types of knives

The most basic types of knifes are:

- **Medium knife** (cuchillo cebollero). The most versatile. 
- **Small knife** (puntilla), also very versatile. To cut vegetables, etc.
- **Butcher knife**, to work with meats and fishes and break bones.
- **Serrated knife** for breads and tomatoes (they are acid, so they're hard to cut with regular knives).
- **Fillet knife** for fish. We know it's a knife for fish because it's flexible.


### Types of cuts

For all the cuts, we have to grab the knife firmly. With the other hand, we will grab the ingredient to cut and contract the fingers, so that the knuckles touch the blade and we cannot cut ourselves.

>Do not use the cutting side of the knife to pick up the cut ingredients, because if we drag it along the board, we will kill it.

>It's essential that the ingredient is firmly based on the cutting area. We can make a first cut to create a plane surface that we can use as support point.

**Grosso modo**

It's a cut without much precission, where it doesn't matter if it looks nice. It's simply cut the pieces in halves or thirds, creating relatively big chunks (1 / 2 cm). An example is cutting potatoes or onions for a stew.

**Brunoise**

It's a cut that consists of cutting regular dices of 2-3 mm by cutting in two directions. So there are 2 sets of cuts: first in one direction, and then in the perpendicular direction.

- For first direction, we should make thin cuts perpendicular to the cutting table. A trick is to make the cuts slightly incomplete, leaving a small tip in the end, so that the slices remain together until we make the cut in the second direction. 

>Some cooks can make this really fast with a **small knife** by using the contracted fingers as guide, although it's important to start slow, learn this well and improve it with practice.

- For the second direction, we should "basculate" the knife instead of making cuts perpendicular to the cutting table. That way, we will avoid crushing ingredients (like onions, which would make us cry). "Basculating" means keeping the tip of the knife on the table, never separating it, and making a curved back-and-forth gesture with the knife. 
 
>If we basculate right and the knife is sharp, we will never cry again when cutting onions. A sign that we are making good cuts (without smashing) with a good knife (sharp) is cutting parsley (perejil) or chives (cebollinos). If we do it wrong, the cutting table will end up tinted with green because we are smashing them.

If we cut several vegetables, it's important to leave the onions for the last. Otherwise, they will impregnate the cutting surface and the rest of ingredients will have some onion flavour.

**Julienne (juliana)**

This is exactly like applying just the second direction of the **brunoise**. Basculating is essential to achieve thin slices without smashing the ingredientes.
