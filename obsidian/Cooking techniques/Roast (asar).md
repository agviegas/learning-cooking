Roasting is one of the most basic and ancient techniques of cooking. The goal is to apply heat directly to the product, altering it and changing its flavour and color, resulting in something that is brownish on the outside and juicy in the inside. It's used mainly for fishes and meats.

There are three types of roasting:

- Grill
- Oven
- On griddle (plancha) or pan

The main difference between them is the size of the pieces that we roast. In the past it was common to roast big pieces, but not so much nowadays. Small pieces are handier and it's much easier to achieve better flavours and juiciness.


### Fishes

The first step is to salt the fish, generally by putting it on water with salt (3 minute for a medium piece). This water is somewhat similar to sea water and will give a lot of flavour to the fish.

After putting the fish out of the water, we should dry it out with kitchen paper. We don't want all that humidity on the pan, as water and very hot oil don't react well. Then, we should paint the fish with oil.

The pan should be very hot before putting the fish on it, and have some oil (2 spoons). Now, there are 2 options: fishes with thick skin, and fishes without thick skin (or without skin at all).

If the fish has a thick skin (e.g. sea bass / lubina) It's recommended to cook it with skin. The process is putting the fish with the skin facing down, and press it for 40 seconds, making sure all the skin is in contact with the pan. That will make the skin isolate the fish from direct contact with the pan, cooking it indirectly. The goal is to make the skin is toasted and crunchy while the fish slowly cooks.

After 4/5 minutes, we could add a a couple of extra oil spoons to the pan (NOT to the fish), keeping the sking facing down. 

We should only turn it over once all the skin is completely toasted and crunchy. After it, it will cook really fast (e.g. 1 minute, until it's caramelized). After it, we could give it 2 / 3 minutes in the oven or in the salamander.

Fishes that don't have a thick skin (or without skin) are roasted very fast. Just painting it with oil, a couple of oil spoons in the pan and it should suffice to guarantee that it's correctly roasted. No need for the longer process described above. Between 1 and 2 minutes should suffice, until we see it caramelize. 

After it, we can give it 2 / 3 minutes in the oven (low temperature) or in the salamander.


### Meats

The goal is to achieve an outter brown (dorado) of the meat, while keeping the interior juiciness. It's very important that the meat is at ambient temperature, so that the heat can penetrate fast into it, making the cooking shorter.

It's also important to use a greasy product on the surface to make the browning process easier. For this, we can paint the meat with oil. Also, we should put a pinch of salt on both sides after painting it. For pepper, it's important to add it **after the cooking** (as well as some additional salt) to avoid burning it.

>The pan should be very hot before putting the meat on it. But we should be very careful, as it's easy to burn it. The difference between an optimal temperature for roasting and a burning temperature is very thin. We should pay close attention to the color of the meat and move it once it has a nice tone on the surface.

We should add a spoon of oil and then the meat. We will be able to see the heat cooking the part of the meat in contact with the pan and penetrating it slowly.

> When roasting we should never move the piece a lot ("no marear la pieza"). 

```
The meat becomes brown when roasting it because of the Maillard reaction. It's the same process as when we caramelize a fruit. In the case of meat the caramelization occurs with the sugars present in its juices. 
```

For bigger meats, it's usual to sear them a bit on the pan ("se sellan en sartén") and then finish them off in the oven (not very high: around 160º for 4 / 5 minutes). Once we put the piece out of the pan, we should paint it again before putting it on the oven. 

>When roasting in the oven, a lot of liquid will come out of the product. A way to reduce it is to toast it first, creating a brown "barrier" that will keep everything inside. But even if we do this, some liquid will come out. To use it, we have two options: if we put some garnish on the oven tray (e.g. potatoes), they will absorb it. If we just have the meat in the tray, we'll find the tray with all this liquid when we pull it out. We can then boil some oporto whine (desglasar) and add this juice, making a fantastic base for a sauce.

After taking the meat out of the oven, it's important to **let it rest** for some minutes (depending on the size: a medium piece could be around 10 minutes). A very interesting option is to put it on the oven at very low temperature (50º for 5 / 10 minutes). That way, the meat will "relax" and the juicies will go back to their original place (during the roasting, the are concentrated into the core, as it can't go out due to the toasted surface).
