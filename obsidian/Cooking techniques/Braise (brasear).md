This method is very interesting for big pieces of meat. The type of meat should be hard, so that it accepts this type of cooking (which is quite slow, which means that the main danger is that the product becomes too dry in the process).

>In this type of cooking it's important to control the interior temperature (with a termometer). 45ยบ - 50ยบ will end up with a more pinkish core, while 75ยบ will be a well-made core.

The first step is to mark the meat in a **deep pan** with oil. The idea is to close the pores on the surface, so that when we braise it, the juices don't come out (just like [[Roast (asar)#Meats|roasting bigger pieces of meat]]).

While the meat is being cooked on the surface in the pan, we have to make a "bresa", which is a set of cut vegetables that we will need for the braising process. This will add some juice to the braise, helping that the main product (the meat) doesn't dry out too much.

We will use a leek (puerro), an onion, a tomato, a couple of carrots, a couple of cloves of garlics and some lay (laurel). We can cut everything in thick slices (grosso modo, 1 / 2 cm).

Different vegetables will give different touches to the final dish. Celery bulb (bulbo de apio) and fennel bulb (bulbo de hinojo) are very interesting additions.
```

>This technique can also be used for fishes, but then the times will be much shorter, and the bresa should have thinner chunks.

Once the meat has all the faces well brown, we should add more oil (because the vegetable will absorb it) and add the bresa to the pan. Until now, the meat has **concentrated**, but when we add the bresa (which is cold), the meat will **expand**, giving away flavour to the vegetables.

Now, we should cover the pan and decrease the temperature a bit. This should cook for 25 min slowly, letting the heat reach the core of the meat and cook the vegetables slowly.

>We should avoid opening the top of the pan in this time to prevent loosing humidity, drying out the products. Keeping the steam inside will ensure that the products stay juicy.

After 25 minutes, we have to open the top of the pan. We should already see quite some liquid and the vegetables being reduced. We'll add some salt, pepper and white wine (it could also be a Jerez, a Brandy, a PX, a sweet wine, an Oporto, etc). Optionally we can add some garnish (mushrooms or onions). 

>Adding different liquors will add different touches to the final dish.

Now we have to options: decrease the temperature, put the top of the pan back and let it cook slowly (1.5 or 2 hours), or put it in the oven. Both options are valid. If we use the oven, it's interesting to use an oven recipient with a top, so that we prevent the steam from going out too much, keeping the flavours.
