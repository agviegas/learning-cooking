Bacteria that deteriorate food love water. Therefore, dry food make it harder for them to proliferate and last for longer.

A very easy way to dehydrate many ingredients is the oven. For example, to dry out some mooshrooms, we can put them in the oven at 40ºC - 50ºC. 

>There are also specific machines to dry products; they are common in restaurants, but not so much in homes.

There are also some dehydration techniques that already cook the products. For instance, we can cut some thin slices of fruits (apples, pears or oranges), paint them with syrup (almíbar tpt) and put them in the oven to dehydrate.

Another technique to dehydrate is lyophilization or freeze-drying. Lyophilization is the chemical process in which water goes directly from solid to gas, without being liquid in the middle. This can be achieve through freezing a product and then applying void to it. 

>Dehydration is also used to make decoration leaves crunchy. We can achieve this by putting a plastic film on a dish and then add a thin layer of oil. Then, we put the leaves (e.g. parsley) on it, and put it in the microwave 1 min at 600W (usually half-power). We repeat this 3-4 times and we will end up with crunchy leaves that are very useful for decorating dishes.
