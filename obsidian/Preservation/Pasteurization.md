Pasteurization is a method whose name comes from Louis Pasteur, a french chemist from the XIX century that discovered that heat could kill bacteria in food, therefore making that food last for longer.

Pasteurization always consists of heating up (always below 100º). There are several types:

- **High pasteurization**: 15 - 20 minutes, 70ºC - 80ºC.
- **Low pasteurization** 20 - 30 minutes, 65ºC - 68º C. This is the most used type.

For preserving vegetables using pasteurization, we should:

- Put them in a jar full of water (without leaving absolutely no air inside).
- Add a bit of lemon juice to make it a bit more acid.
- Put the jar to a pot full of water between 65ºC and 68ºC (with a termometer).
- Leave it there for 30 minutes.
- Put the jar in water with ice to make it cold very fast (so that the food is as little time as possible in risky temperatures where bacteria proliferate, between 28º and 40º).

>The downside of pasteurization is that it alters a bit the ingredients because they are partially cooked in the process. This can be a benefit though if we want to cook ingredients with low temperatures, so that we would be leaving them already prepared to be used in the future.

>We know a product has been correctly pasteurized because there's no air inside, and because when we open the jar, it must have formed a little void inside, generating some opening resistance and a "plop" opening sound.
